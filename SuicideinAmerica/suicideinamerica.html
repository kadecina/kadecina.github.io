<p> If you fall and scrape your knee, you’re not ashamed to ask for a band aid. If you have depression, you shouldn’t be ashamed to seek help.</p> “Mental health is just like your physical health,” said Victoria Petherick, a senior counselor at Best Self Behavior Health. </p>


<p> Suicide is a growing issue in the United States and all around the world, although it is not talked about as often as it should be. It is critical that as a society, we break the stigma around mental health in order to spread awareness and allow people to get the help they need. </p>

<p> What is stigma? A stigma is a negative social attitude attached to a person or group, often placing shame on them for a perceived deficiency. Although as a society more people are experiencing declining mental health, especially since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have not done enough to change our attitudes around mental health. There is still a negative connotation towards living with mental illness, causing people to avoid treatment and support. </p>

<p> “The pandemic has caused those suffering with mental health problems who already feel isolated to notice it even more. Many people from high risk populations already have reduced access to the things they need, like food, money, transportation, and social support. The pandemic has made that more pronounced,” informed Victoria Petherick. Petherick who works at Best Self Behavior Health pointed out that due to the increase in patients due to COVID-19, NYS instituted emergency regulations that allowed behavioral health agencies to use tele-therapy. With the new regulations, BestSelf was able to start a new program, 24/7 Virtual Treatment which allows for rapid access to treatment via telephone and zoom which wasn’t an option before. </p>

<p> Suicide is a serious public health problem and a leading cause of death in America. There have been 48,170 deaths by suicide in New York in the years 2003-2018 alone. Data shows that victims of suicide range in age from children under 9 years old, all the way to adults age 85. These statistics shows how widespread of a problem suicide is.</p>

<p> Licensed Clinical Psychologist, Dr. Elizabeth Courtney-Seidler of Cognitive & Behavioral Therapies of Ridgefield, believes that breaking the stigma and suicide prevention begins at a young age. Dr. Courtney-Seider supports the implementation of mental health curriculum in schools. By doing this, schools would be promoting open discussion about emotions and learning tools to cope more effectively with them. Dr. Courtney-Seidler says, “Parents and educators are key to helping children learn at a young age how to identify emotions and learn strategies to regulate them more effectively. Parents can also talk about their own mental health and tools they use to maintain it.” She recommends parents openly share strategies with their children that the children themself can mimic. For instance, parents can explain to their kids, “Mommy is happier and less frustrated when she exercises and gets lots of sleep.” Teaching kids to openly talk through their emotions and regulate them at a young age will benefit them throughout their lives. </p>

<p> Suicide impacts all different types of people, and can be brought on by many factors, but there are some correlations based on data and recognized by professionals. Studies have shown that men are more likely to complete a suicide attempt, while women have more attempts. Dr. Courtney-Seidler revealed that teenage girls attempting suicide has increased by 50% since the start of the pandemic. Both Dr. Courtney-Seidler and Petherick agreed that in general, adult men tend to complete more suicide attempts because of their use of lethal means that don’t allow time for anyone to intervene. Firearm statistics support this trend as 1 in 6 gun owners are men and firearms account for half of suicides. </p>

<p> It is important to note the resources your state provides in order to get help. In New York there are 221 emergency programs, 141 inpatient programs, 823 outpatient programs, 1,590 residential programs and 2,416 support programs, making up 5,191 mental health programs in New York State. </p>

<p> Spend time looking at different types of treatment to determine which type is right for you or your loved one. In regards to what type of treatment is most effective for suicide prevention, Petherick says, “Suicide affects so many different types of people. In my opinion, intensive outpatient services are very effective in preventing suicide. Emergency programs, especially emergency rooms, can often be traumatic for clients who are in a crisis. Residential programs are often understaffed, and the staff who are there are usually not qualified to act when a client is in a psychiatric crisis.” Outpatient programs consist of 45-60 minute sessions once a week with a therapist and supportive resources are available if needed. </p>
